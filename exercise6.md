## What is necessary to generate Maven site documentation?
A structure of the project

## What different aspects, configurations, information, etc. are configured in site.xml or pom.xml?
- A project object model or POM is the basic unit of work in Maven. It is an XML file that contains information about the project and configuration details used by Maven to build the project. It contains default values for most projects. Examples include the build directory, which is target, the source directory, which is src/main/java, the test source directory. When running a task or target, Maven looks in the current directory for the POM. It reads the POM, retrieves the required configuration information, and then executes the target.

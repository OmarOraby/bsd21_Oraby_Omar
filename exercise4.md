The test cases are specifically adapted to the corresponding methods and are programmed in Java with the integration of the JUnit library. I have for each of the 4 methods add, minus, multiply and divide. For the methods I have different calculation methods. With result I compared the result or sometimes I wrote a value as comparison to it. To create an object calculator I used the notation @BeforeAll.

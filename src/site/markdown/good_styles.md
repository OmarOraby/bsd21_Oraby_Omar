## How to write good comments

## Tips for good comments
Comments should not duplicate code.
Good comments are not an excuse for unclear code.
Comments should eliminate confusion, not cause it.
Provide links to the original source of the copied code.
Include links to external references where they will be most helpful.
If you can't write a clear comment, maybe there's a problem with the code.

# Choices and loops program

A very basic calculator application created with Java.

**Requirements**

You will need a Java Runtime environment installed on the computer. You can easily install one.

## Installation
* Import the class in Intellij IDEA or any other Java IDE.

* Run the class ChoicesAndLoops.



## Usage
You will be asked to put an amount.
It must be greater than 0, otherwise the program will ask you to put another number.

```java
Amount: 3
#1: 
#2:
#3:
```
As shown you have then to enter integer numbers.

## Result
```java
sum = 
min = 
max = 
mean = 
Reciprocal of mean = 
Additive inverse of mean = 
Absolute value of mean = 
Delta of minimum and maximum = 
Sum of numbers from minimum to maximum =  
```
Those are the calculating, that will be made from your input as a user.
